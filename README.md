# Vaccine-Tracking-System
The Vaccine Tracking System project is designed to streamline the process of tracking and monitoring the distribution of vaccines. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it has become more important than ever to have an efficient and accurate way of tracking the distribution of vaccines to ensure that they are reaching those who need them the most. 

It allows users to input their demographic data as well as data about their vaccine status. The system can track the number of vaccines received, id and location. the program also generates analytics to provide insights into the effectiveness of the vaccine distribution process.

The system is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive interface that can be easily navigated by patients with varying levels of technical expertise.
